# healthcare-interoperability-claims-analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes healthcare claims data to quantify revenue leakage caused by poor interoperability between healthcare providers.

## Problem
Fragmented health data leads to:
- Missing diagnosis information
- Duplicate procedures
- High claim rejection rates
- Delayed or lost revenue for providers

## Methodology
Using simulated healthcare claims data, I:
- Calculated total claim value
- Identified rejected claims and their financial impact
- Analyzed root causes of rejection
- Estimated avoidable losses linked to data interoperability gaps

## Key Findings
- 37.5% of total claim value was rejected
- Missing diagnosis data was the leading cause of rejection
- ₦160,000 in claims value could potentially be recovered through interoperable records

## Skills Demonstrated
- Healthcare finance analysis
- Data-driven decision making
- Claims revenue leakage analysis
- Executive-level insight communication
